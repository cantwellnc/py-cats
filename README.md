# py-cats
Exploring the design challenges of implementing various category-theoretic concepts in Python. 

# What this is
This is an attempt at using **[Design-By-Contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract)** principles to 
implement some concepts from category theory! 

# What this is not
It is not a performant implementation of these concepts (at this time). It's just me working out how to write abstractions and algorithms for them.
